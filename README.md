## 1. Introduction

In a context where food transparency and public health are increasingly important concerns, the Open Food Facts association has created an open database compiling information on thousands of food products worldwide. The Nutri-Score, a key indicator of nutritional quality, is assigned to many products, but some do not yet have one. To address this gap, we aim to explore the possibility of automatically predicting the Nutri-Score based on nutritional information.

This project aims to develop a prototype web application that will predict the Nutri-Score of a food product using a machine learning model trained on existing data. In addition to prediction, this project will offer an opportunity to explore and model massive datasets while learning project management and collaborative work.

## 2. Project Background

In a world where food transparency and public health are critical issues, the Open Food Facts association has developed an open database that compiles information on thousands of food products globally. The Nutri-Score, an important indicator of nutritional quality, is assigned to many products, but some are still missing this information. To tackle this challenge, solutions are needed to automatically predict the Nutri-Score based on nutritional data.

## 3. Objectives

The objective of this project is to create a prototype web application capable of predicting the Nutri-Score of food products using a machine learning model trained on existing data. In addition to the prediction task, this project will explore and model large datasets, while providing hands-on experience in project management and collaborative work.
